# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find SDKs and libraries for a bunch of different technologies to work with the Kinde ecosystem.

If you have an existing project, this is a great place to get started.

Instructions on how to get up and going exist in the relevant repoâ€™s README, or you can read the [Kinde documentation](https://kinde.com/docs). For contributing guidelines, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/kinde-oss/.github/blob/489e2ca9c3307c2b2e098a885e22f2239116394a/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc.

Consider using one of our [Kinde starter kits](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits) if you're starting from scratch.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find SDKs and libraries for a bunch of different technologies to work with the Kinde ecosystem.

If you have an existing project, this is a great place to get started. Instructions on how to get up and going can be found on the repo for your technology of choice or you can read the [Kinde documentation](https://kinde.com/docs)

If you're starting from scratch, consider using one of our [Kinde starter kits repos](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits)
